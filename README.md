# Ravibert

## Description

Ravibert is my (Ravi's) AI project that utilizes Bert technology (or not). While not strictly limited to Bert, the primary objective is to create a chatbot for my personal website, enhancing user interaction and providing a dynamic and personalized experience.

## Project Goals

1. **Chatbot Development**: The main focus is on developing a chatbot that can intelligently respond to user queries and engage in meaningful conversations.

2. **Personalization**: Implement features that allow the chatbot to provide personalized responses based on user preferences and historical interactions.

3. **Website Integration**: Integrate the chatbot seamlessly into my personal website to enhance user experience and accessibility.

## Resources

The `/resources` directory contains essential files and assets for the project:

- **/models**: Placeholder for any machine learning models, including Bert or other NLP models used by Ravibert.

- **/scripts**: Contains scripts related to chatbot logic, interaction, and any backend processes.

- **/frontend**: Resources for integrating the chatbot into the website's frontend, including styles, scripts, and user interface components.
